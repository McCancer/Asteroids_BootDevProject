# Asteroids_BootDevProject
This is a guided project from boot.dev. it has a set of learning goals. 
1. Introduction to Multi-file python projects
2. Show a real world use case for object-oriented programming in python

On Personal note I have previously wrote Asteroids from scratch in java for a high school final project.

- Add a scoring system (Easy)
- Implement multiple lives and respawning (Easy)
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids

- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing (Easy)
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
