# Asteroids_BootDevProject
This is a guided project from boot.dev. it has a set of learning goals. 
1. Introduction to Multi-file python projects
2. Show a real world use case for object-oriented programming in python

On Personal note I have previously wrote Asteroids from scratch in java for a high school final project.
